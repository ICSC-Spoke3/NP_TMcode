# Folder instructions

This directory contains test data for the `trapping` code.

## Instructions

As of M9, `trapping` has only been ported to _C++_ and not yet parallelized. Instructions to test this part of the code are very similar to those concerning `sphere` and `cluster`, i.e. the code needs to be run using the available input files and checking for the consistency of the resulting output files.
