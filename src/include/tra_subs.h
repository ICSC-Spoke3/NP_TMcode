 * \brief C++ porting of TRAPPING functions and subroutines.
 *
 * This library includes a collection of functions that are used to solve the
 * trapping problem. The functions that were generalized from the case of the
 * single sphere are imported the `sph_subs.h` library. As it occurs with the
 * single sphere case functions, in most cases, the results of calculations do
 * not fall back to fundamental data types. They are rather multi-component
 * structures. In order to manage access to such variety of return values, most
 * functions are declared as `void` and they operate on output arguments passed
 * by reference.
