# NP_TMcode project

This project is the T-matrix based suite of codes by the Messina group (Borghese, Denti, Saija, Iat√¨) to compute scattering and extinction properties of realistic particles that can be represented as an arbitrary assembly of individually spherically symmetric subparticles, whose classical optical constants are known. Using an arbitrarily large set of arbitrarily small spherically symmetric subparticles one can obviously approximate any real particle, very much as small enough pixels can approximate an image.

The aim of the project, funded by PNRR-CNS, is to refactor the original, very old legacy Fortran codes, casting them in a modern language that allows them to be parallelised and run efficiently on current and forthcoming HPC architectures.

The current implementation offers a set of elementary tests to check that the original FORTRAN code can be compiled and executed on a limited set of pre-defined input data. The functionality of this initial stage can be verified by cloning the gitLab repository on a local machine and building the binaries from the `src` folder.

Distributing the code and its sources is possible under the terms of the GNU GPLv3 license (see *License* below). Use of this code and of any derived implementation should credit the original authors. Scientific publications should do so by citing the following references:

- Saija et al. 2001, ApJ, 559, 993, DOI:10.1086/322350
- Borghese, Denti, Saija 2007, Scattering from Model Nonspherical Particles (ISBN 978-3-540-37413-8), DOI:10.1007/978-3-540-37414-5

*NOTE:* The building process requires a working installation of a C++ and a FORTRAN compiler. Many solutions are available, but the recommended option is the *GNU Compiler Collection* `gcc` with the addition of `g++` and `gfortran`. Single-workstation multi-threaded parallelism is supported through _OpenMP_, while the multi-node code implementation further requires the use of parallel compilers complying with the _MPI_ standard (_OpenMPI_, _MPICH_).
